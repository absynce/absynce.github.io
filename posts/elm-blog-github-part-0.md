# elm-blog-github - Part 0 - Introduction

If you're new to Elm and looking for a way to get started, look no further...

## Learn Elm while writing a blog on GitHub Pages.

I like to learn by doing. This led me to create a blog in [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/) and write about how to create a blog in Elm in the process. I also wanted to make it easy to share. Therefore the walkthrough includes hosting it on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

This is a beginner tutorial, assuming no prior knowledge of Elm other than some light setup and an overview of Elm syntax on [_An Introduction to Elm_](https://guide.elm-lang.org/) in the ["Core Language" section](https://guide.elm-lang.org/core_language.html).

The format attempts to follow Richard Feldman's suggestions in his talk at elm-conf 2017 ["Teaching Elm to Beginners"](https://youtu.be/G-GhUxeYc1U) by providing as few detours from the goal as possible. I deviate a bit from that recommendation at the end, in Part 3, where I summarize some things used that you don't _need_ to know.

Without further ado:
* [Part 1 - Host Elm code on GitHub](#!/post/elm-blog-github-part-1-host-elm-code-on-github)
* [Part 2 - Add title and content areas](#!/post/elm-blog-github-part-2-add-title-and-content-areas)
* [Part 3 - Add multiple pages](#!/post/elm-blog-github-part-3-add-multiple-pages)
