# elm-blog-github - Part 0 - Introduction

If you're new to Elm and looking for a way to get started, look no further...

## Learn Elm while writing a blog on GitHub Pages.

I like to learn by doing. This led me to create a blog in [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/) and write about how to create a blog in Elm in the process. I also wanted to make it easy to share. Therefore the walkthrough includes hosting it on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

This is a beginner tutorial, assuming no prior knowledge of Elm other than some light setup and an overview of Elm syntax on [_An Introduction to Elm_](https://guide.elm-lang.org/) in the ["Core Language" section](https://guide.elm-lang.org/core_language.html).
